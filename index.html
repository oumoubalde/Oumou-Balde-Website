		<p>Hello!! Welcome to my website. My Name is Oumou Balde, I am a student at Bronx Community College majoring in Computer Information System with concentration in Web Page Development. My educational goals are to graduate in December 2017 for my associate degree and get into a four-year college where I can earn a bachelor degree in Web Development/Database Management.</p>
		
		<p> The number of women studying Technology is decreasing whereas the number of women leaving the tech-industry is increasing. Although this possess a threat to my future aspirations, I am still determined to pursue my goals in life.</p>
		<p>My goal in life is to become a web developer. I choose that because I like being in the other side of the computer. Coding and designing a website or un application and manipulating databases that people, companies, and government agencies can use. Also, the Web is evolving so fast that Web development is the present and future job of the world. Everyone at some point will want to look for an information in the Web or put an information in the Web. </p>
		<p>I want to be a role model for my three children by showing them that education is the key of success, specially to my daughter, that a woman also can have the future she wants. That if a person want something and is willing to do it, he/she can achieve everything with the right help and connection.  </p>
